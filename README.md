🐍 Python: History

**Creation (Late 1980s)**

Invented by **Guido van Rossum** in the Netherlands.
He started working on Python in 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI).


**First Release (1991)**

Python 0.9.0 was released.
Included: functions, exceptions, and core data types (str, list, dict).


**Python 2 (2000)**

Added more features, but had some design issues.
Problem: Python 2 and Python 3 were not fully compatible.

**Python 3 (2008 - Present)**

Major improvements → cleaner syntax, better libraries.
Still the main version used today (Python 3.12+).


**Now (2025)**

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
Used by companies like Google, Netflix, NASA, Instagram, Spotify.


**Applications of Python**

Python is versatile. Here are its main applications:

**1. 🌐 Web Development**

Frameworks: Django, Flask, FastAPI.
Example: Instagram, Pinterest, Spotify use Python for their backend.

**2. 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**

Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn.
Used for: Chatbots, Image Recognition, Self-driving cars.

**3. 📊 Data Science & Analytics**

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
Example: Stock market analysis, weather forecasting, business analytics.

**4. 🔧 Automation & Scripting**

Automating daily tasks (e.g., renaming files, scraping websites, sending emails).
Example: "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" is a famous book.

**5. 🎮 Game Development**

Library: Pygame.
Used for 2D games and prototypes.

**6. 📱 App Development**

Frameworks: Kivy, BeeWare.
Cross-platform apps for Android, iOS, Windows.

**7. 🛰 Scientific & Research Work**

Used by NASA for simulations.
Libraries: SciPy, SymPy, Biopython (biology).

**8. ☁️ Cloud Computing & Cybersecurity**

Cloud automation, penetration testing (with tools like Paramiko, Scapy).

**Summary:**

History → Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1989, first released in 1991.

Applications → From websites to AI, data science, automation, apps, and research, Python is used everywhere.
