    "year" : 2023
}

print(book.items())

# 2. Add a new key "price" with some value to the dictionary.

book ["price"] = 299

print(book.items())


# 3. Update the "year" of the book to a new year.

book ["year"] = 2024

print(book.items())


# 4. Remove the "author" key from the dictionary.

book.pop("author")
print(book.items()) 
print(book)

# 5. Write a program to print only the keys of a dictionary.

print (book.keys())'''


# üîπ Intermediate (Dictionaries)

# 6. Create a dictionary of 3 students with their marks. Find the average marks.
# Example: {"A": 85, "B": 90, "C": 78}

'''students = {
    "A" : 85,
    "B" : 90,
    "C" : 78
}

average_marks = sum(students.values()) / len(students)

print(average_marks)'''



# 7. Check if a key "Python" exists in a dictionary.

'''my_dict = {
    "java" : 80,
    "c++"  : 78,
